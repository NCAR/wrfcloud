Forecast Viewer
===============

The forecast plots can be accessed by clicking on the Job ID or "Open Viewer" button on that job from WRF Jobs menu option. This will open the Forecast Viewer for that job. Each available product will be listed in the right-hand menu and can be toggled on/off with the checkmark. Each product also has a transparency slider bar to adjust the field's transparency. Additionally, there is a Political Boundaries selector at the top of the products list that can be toggled on/off depending on preference. Automation play/pause/advance buttons and slider can be found at the bottom of the map.
