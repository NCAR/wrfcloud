At this time, the WRF Cloud framework can be installed by the developers. It is expected that in coming releases there will be a python script that will walk the user through a series of questions to configure the system on their own AWS account. Additional information about requirements for successful installation will be added in the sections below once this feature is fully functional and supported. 

Programming Languages
=====================

* Python

Prerequisites
=============

* AWS Account
* Python 3.9+

Procedures for initial installation
===================================

This framework currently requires a developer to install. Future releases will support a user guided installation.
